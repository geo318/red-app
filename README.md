# Javascript multi step Form
> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this form, I use some validations, various custom styled inputs, including image uploader etc.

You can either visit a Heroku Deployment or clone the repo locally,
> then:

### `npm start`

That's all,

### `Thanks`
